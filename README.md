This morning we talked about Swift programming language.

Swift is a general-purpose language developed by Apple built for 
  modernity, 
  safety & power. 
  
Swift helps reducing errors. Swift development began in 2010 and it was released in 2014. Latest version is 4. You can check the version of yours through terminal:

swift -version

Some specific about Swift:

1.    Swift is written from ground up to be a modern language.
2.    ObjC has been around for many years and things are added to it.
3.    Swift runs faster.
4.    Swift is easier to read and easier to learn.
5.    Swift follows a single file (unified) mode. (no .h and .m. Only a .swift).
6.    Swift has no pointers
7.    Swift has better memory management. (across all APIs)
8.    Swift usually requires less coding

Swift vs ObjC Syntax

1.    Swift will eventually become the primary language. For now, it's best to learn both.
2.    If you come from a different language, i.e. C#, C++ then swift is easier to pick up and vice versa.
3.    Many frameworks and libraries are still written in ObjC.

Swift language guide (Swift or ObjC)

Swift offers interactive programming through Playground software and iPad app.

It supports all the basic operators: =, +, -, *, /, % and it does so for most variables such as

var a:String = "hello"
var b:String = "World"
var res = a + " " + b

Beyond string concatenation with +, you can use equality with == as well as multi line with """ String manipulation in swift is generally easier than ObjC

Swift supports unary plus and minus and compound operator: -i, +i, += , -= Comparisons: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==

Ternary if statement: a = True ? 1 : 0

And, Not and Or logical operators: &&, !i, ||

Collections Swift has three collection type:

1.    Arrays ordered but not unique
2.    Sets un-ordered arrays with unique values
3.    And dictionaries
